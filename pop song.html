    <br><p>Mmm
    <br>Hey, yeah
    <br>(That's just for fun)
    <br>(What?)
    <br>Ah</p>
<p><br>I'm not one to stick around
    <br>One strike and you're out, baby
    <br>Don't care if I sound crazy
    <br>But you never let me down, no, no
    <br>That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
    <br>Still layin' in your bed, sayin'
    <br>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
    <br>Got all this time on my hands
    <br>Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
    <br>I could stay here for a lifetime
    <br>So, lock the door and throw out the key
    <br>Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
    <br>And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
    <br>I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
    <br>So, go ahead and drive me insane
    <br>Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
    <br>Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
    <br>I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby</p>
<p><br>There's nowhere we need to be, no, no, no
    <br>I'ma get to know you better
    <br>Kinda hope we're here forever
    <br>There's nobody on these streets
    <br>If you told me that the world's endin'
    <br>Ain't no other way that I can spend it
    <br>Oh, oh, oh, oh (Ooh)
    <br>Got all this time in my hands
    <br>Might as well cancel our plans (Yeah, yeah)
    <br>I could stay here forever
    <br>So, lock the door and throw out the key
    <br>Can't fight this no more, It's just you and me
    <br>And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
    <br>I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you</p>
<p><br>So, go ahead and drive me insane
    <br>Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
    <br>Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
    <br>I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you</p>
<p><br>Woah
    <br>Baby, come take all my time
    <br>Go on, make me lose my mind
    <br>We got all that we need here tonight
    <br>I lock the door (Lock the door) and throw out the key
    <br>Can't fight this no more (Can't fight this no more), it's just you and me
    <br>And there's nothin' I, nothin' I'd rather do
    <br>I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you</p>
<p><br>So, go ahead and drive me insane
    <br>Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
    <br>All this lovin' you, hatin' you, wantin' you
    <br>I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with
    <br>You, oh, oh
    <br>Stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you</p></ul>
